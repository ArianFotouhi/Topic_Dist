## This NLP based application clusters the topics according to the input essay. 

### LDA.ipynb:

#### Words are vectorized using CountVectorizer technique

#### LDA is applied and n_components is set to 7 as the number of toppics (we tested different numbers)

#### Then top 15 words (highest probability) of each topic are shown that helps to guess the topic domain

#### Lastly a user made sample is tested on the app




### NMF.ipynb:

#### Words are vectorized using TFIDF technique

#### NMF is applied and n_components is set to 7 as the number of toppics (we tested different numbers)

#### Then top 15 words (highest probability) of each topic are shown that helps to guess the topic domain

#### Lastly a user made sample is tested on the app
